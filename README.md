# Problem:
"I want to keep track of the movies on a To-Watch list, but want to know where to find the movie so that I can actually start working through my list!"

# General App Idea:
An app to keep track of every movie the user has ever seen, as well as movies the user would like to see. Upon seeing a movie, the user's "to-watch" movie will switch to their "watched" collection, where they can rate and review the film. The app will contain info for each movie such as Rotten Tomatoes ratings, IMDB rating, synopsis, cast and crew, but most importantly *where the movie can be viewed*, ie Netflix, Hulu, Amazon / showtimes if movie is currently in theaters.
